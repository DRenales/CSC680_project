# Project for CSC680 Database Web Interfaces
The project I decided to run with for this course was a database visualizer. <br>
Specifically, this would visualize a sample data set regarding COVID-19 statistics pulled from the WHO.<br><br>

# Steps For Running This Locally
1) Download XAMPP from <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html">here</a>
2) Run XAMPP as admin and start both the apache and MySQL services
3) Move the files within this directory into your "\*/XAMPP/htdocs" folder
4) In the XAMPP controller, hit the "Admin" button for MySQL to be brought to PHPMyAdmin
5) Import the SQL file to create the database 
6) Open your browser an type localhost/\*/html/index.html to run reach the main page
